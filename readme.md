### Vision
A dashboard that allows people to see the frequencies of AIS signal disappearing. 

The complete product would allow people to view the missing events across the globe, and filter by country, type of fishing vessel. It would also list the top offenders in terms of countries, vessel id, vessel class, vessel size, etc. 

This can be presented as an interactive website or as a Power BI dashboard, with an accompanying article explaining all findings. 

### Ideas
- Plot beginning and ending of missing transponders
- Plot (as lines/arrows) start and end point of missing ships. 
- Time: duration of missing signal; ~~ what time of day did they go missing, etc. ~~
- Mark top X offenders (unique ships)
- Filters by nationality
- Filter by vessle type
- Filter by duration / distance gap
- Overlay missing AIS events with world fishery abbundance data. 
- ~~Get local time of occuring event~~
- How far, on average, does each vessels from each country travel. Do they do this only around neighboring waters or globally?
